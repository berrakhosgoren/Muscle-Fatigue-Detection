# Muscle-Fatigue-Detection

The project aims to process electromyography (EMG) signals recorded from one human subject to identify signs of muscle fatigue. It involves implementing feature extraction methods and two different classifiers (linear and deep learning model) and evaluating the performance of the classifiers using metrics such as ROC curve and confusion matrix.

## Code Structure

The project's code is organized as follows:

- **main.py/**: Main entry point for the project, orchestrating both linear and deep learning models.
- **utils.py/**: Helper functions used across the project.
- **preprocessing.py/**: Script for importing and preprocessing the EMG signals.
- **feature_engineering.py/**: Script for extracting features from the preprocessed signals.
- **RNN.py/**: Script containing the implementation of the recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier.

## Usage

Project can be executed by running the 'main.py' script.

## Classification Models

### Linear Model: 
Logistic Regression

### Deep Learning Model:
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
